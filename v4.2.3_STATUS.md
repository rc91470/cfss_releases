# CFSS v4.2.3 Release Status

## Current State
- **macOS v4.2.3**: ✅ COMPLETE (Built and ready)
- **Windows v4.2.3**: ❌ NEEDS BUILD (Windows maintainer required)

## What's Done
1. **Source Code**: v4.2.3 source code captured in `v4.2.3/src/`
2. **macOS Build**: Successfully built and available in `releases/macos/v4.2.3/`
3. **Build Scripts**: Both `build_macos.sh` and `build_windows.bat` ready
4. **Documentation**: README updated to reflect current status
5. **Repository Structure**: Organized for platform separation

## What's Needed
1. **Windows Build**: Windows maintainer needs to:
   - Navigate to `v4.2.3/`
   - Run `build_windows.bat`
   - Copy results to `releases/windows/v4.2.3/`
   - Update `releases/windows/latest/`

2. **Release Preparation**: After Windows build:
   - Update README badges to v4.2.3
   - Create GitHub release with both files
   - Update version history table
   - Test both platforms

## Version Synchronization
Both builds use the EXACT same source code from `v4.2.3/src/` to ensure:
- Feature parity
- Bug fix consistency
- Version number accuracy
- Auto-updater compatibility

## Files Ready for Release
- `releases/macos/v4.2.3/CFSS-macOS-4.2.3.tar.gz` (22MB)
- `releases/macos/v4.2.3/checksums.txt`
- `releases/macos/v4.2.3/macos_fix.sh`
- `releases/windows/v4.2.3/` (waiting for Windows build)

## Next Steps
1. Windows maintainer builds from `v4.2.3/src/`
2. Both builds tested
3. GitHub release created
4. Version officially released

**DO NOT UPDATE VERSION NUMBERS OR RELEASE UNTIL BOTH PLATFORMS ARE READY**
