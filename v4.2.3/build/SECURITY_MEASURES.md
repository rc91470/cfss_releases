# CFSS Security Measures - Customer Data Protection

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to ensure that **NO CUSTOMER DATA** is ever included in builds, releases, or committed to the git repository.

## üîí Security Layers

### 1. **Build Script Protection**
Both `build_macos.sh` and `build_windows.bat` automatically:
- Run security checks before building
- Create backups of existing data
- Clean all CSV files from the data folder
- Create empty data folder with `.gitkeep` only
- Prevent any customer data from being included in the build

### 2. **PyInstaller Specification**
The `cfss_app.spec` file:
- Explicitly excludes `data/*.csv` files
- Only includes the empty data folder structure
- Contains security comments explaining the exclusion

### 3. **Git Protection (.gitignore)**
Comprehensive `.gitignore` rules that exclude:
- All CSV files (`data/*.csv`)
- Database files (`*.db`)
- Log files (`*.log`)
- Scan backups (`scan_backups/`)
- Export directories (`sharepoint_export/`, `issue_reports/`)
- Configuration files (`sharepoint_config.json`, `csv_hash_cache.json`)
- Any customer data files or directories

### 4. **Security Check Script**
`security_check.sh` performs pre-build verification:
- Scans for CSV files in data directory
- Checks for database files with customer data
- Identifies log files that might contain customer info
- Detects scan backup directories
- Finds export directories with potential customer data
- Provides clear warnings and guidance

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Workflow

### Before Building:
1. **Run Security Check**: `./security_check.sh`
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Build scripts clean data folder
3. **Backup Creation**: Customer data is backed up locally (not in build)
4. **Verification**: Only empty data folder with `.gitkeep` is included

### During Build:
1. **Clean Environment**: Only application code and empty data structure
2. **No Customer Data**: PyInstaller spec excludes all customer files
3. **Safe Distribution**: Final build contains no sensitive information

### After Build:
1. **Data Restoration**: Backups remain available locally
2. **Safe Distribution**: Release contains no customer data
3. **Clean Repository**: Git never contains customer information

## üìÅ File Structure Protection

### ‚úÖ What IS included in builds:
- Application code (`cfss_app.py`, etc.)
- Empty data folder with `.gitkeep`
- Sound files
- Documentation
- Requirements and specifications

### ‚ùå What is NEVER included:
- CSV files (`*.csv`)
- Database files (`*.db`)
- Log files (`*.log`)
- Scan progress (`scan_backups/`)
- Export data (`sharepoint_export/`, `issue_reports/`)
- Configuration files (`sharepoint_config.json`)
- Any customer-specific data

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Customer Data is Found in Build:
1. **STOP DISTRIBUTION** immediately
2. Remove the compromised build
3. Run security check: `./security_check.sh`
4. Clean the environment
5. Rebuild with proper security measures
6. Verify clean build before redistribution

### If Customer Data is in Git:
1. **DO NOT PUSH** changes
2. Remove files from git: `git rm --cached data/*.csv`
3. Update `.gitignore` if needed
4. Clean repository history if necessary
5. Verify no sensitive data in git log

## üîß Security Commands

### Manual Security Check:
```bash
./security_check.sh
```

### Manual Data Cleaning:
```bash
# Backup first
cp -r data data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Clean CSV files
rm -f data/*.csv

# Create .gitkeep
touch data/.gitkeep
```

### Verify Clean Build:
```bash
# Check data folder
ls -la data/

# Should only show .gitkeep file
# No .csv files should be present
```

## üìã Security Checklist

Before each release:
- [ ] Run `./security_check.sh`
- [ ] Verify no CSV files in data folder
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` is comprehensive
- [ ] Ensure build scripts clean data
- [ ] Test build in clean environment
- [ ] Verify distributed build contains no customer data
- [ ] Document any security improvements

## üéØ Key Principles

1. **Default Secure**: Builds are secure by default
2. **Multiple Layers**: Multiple independent security measures
3. **Automatic Protection**: Security is automatic, not manual
4. **Clear Warnings**: Obvious alerts when customer data is present
5. **Zero Trust**: Assume customer data could be anywhere, protect against it

## üìû Contact

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or have concerns about customer data protection, immediately:
1. Stop any distribution activities
2. Document the issue
3. Contact the development team
4. Do not proceed until security is verified

**Remember: Customer data protection is paramount. When in doubt, err on the side of caution.**
