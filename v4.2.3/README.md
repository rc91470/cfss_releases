## üöÄ Development Workflow

### For Development
1. **Work in this repository** (cfss_app) for all code changes
2. **Test locally** using the development environment
3. **Build releases** using the build scripts
4. **Use the release automation** to push binaries to public repo

### For Releases
1. **Test locally** using `build_windows.bat` or `build_macos.sh` (development testing only)
2. **Switch to cfss_releases repository** for official builds:
   ```bash
   cd ../cfss_releases
   # Follow the build and release process documented there
   ```
3. **Review** the built files in the cfss_releases repository
4. **Create GitHub release** in the cfss_releases repository

## üìÅ Original Application Description

- Git with GitHub CLI (`gh`) configured

### Initial Setup
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rc91470/cfss_app.git
   cd cfss_app
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   setup_dev_windows.bat
   
   # macOS
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```bash
   start_dev.bat  # Windows
   python cfss_app.py  # macOS/Linux
   ```

## üîß Build Process

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Development vs Distribution**

**This repository is for DEVELOPMENT ONLY!**
- **NO .exe or .app files** should ever be committed here
- **NO distribution builds** should be done in this repository
- This repository contains source code and development tools only

### For Official Builds and Releases
**Use the `cfss_releases` repository for all distribution builds:**
1. **Clone cfss_releases**: `git clone https://github.com/rc91470/cfss_releases.git`
2. **Use the build scripts there** for creating distributable .exe and .app files
3. **Create releases there** for public distribution

### Development Testing (Local Only)
The build scripts in this repository are for **local development testing only**:

```bash
# For local development testing only (creates files in dist/ - not for distribution)
./build_macos.sh     # macOS - creates .app for local testing
build_windows.bat    # Windows - creates .exe for local testing
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit the generated dist/ or build/ folders!**

### Security First - Customer Data Protection
**üö® CRITICAL: All builds automatically exclude customer data!**

The build process includes multiple security layers:
- **Automatic CSV cleaning** - No customer data in builds
- **Pre-build security checks** - Scans for sensitive data
- **Comprehensive .gitignore** - Prevents commits of customer data
- **Security documentation** - See `SECURITY_MEASURES.md`

### Repository Separation
- **cfss** (this repo): Private development, source code, no builds
- **cfss_releases**: Public distribution, compiled builds, user documentation

## üìö Documentation

### Internal Documentation
- Development notes in source code
- API documentation in comments
- Build process documentation in scripts

### Public Documentation
- User guides in the **public repository** at `https://github.com/rc91470/cfss_releases`
- Installation instructions for end users
- Troubleshooting guides for support

## üîê Security Notes

- **Never commit** sensitive data (passwords, keys, tokens)
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Review** all commits before pushing
- **Keep dependencies** updated and secure
