# CFSS Quick Reference Guide

## üöÄ Building & Releasing

### Build the App Locally (Development Testing Only)
```bash
cd /Users/richardcoleman/VSCode/CFSS
./build_macos.sh
```
**Result:** Creates `dist/CFSS.app` for local development testing only
**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This is for development testing only. All official releases must be done in cfss_releases repository.

### Official Releases (Use cfss_releases Repository)
All official builds and releases are done in the cfss_releases repository:
- Clone: https://github.com/rc91470/cfss_releases
- Follow the build and release process documented there
- Public releases are published at: https://github.com/rc91470/cfss_releases/releases

### Test a Draft Release
```bash
# This must be done in cfss_releases repository
./draft_release.sh
```
**What it does:** Builds app, creates archive, uploads draft to GitHub
**Result:** Draft release at https://github.com/rc91470/cfss_releases/releases

### Create Official Release
```bash
# This must be done in cfss_releases repository
./release.sh
```
**What it does:** Creates official release with proper version tag

### Update Version
```bash
# Update version in cfss development repo first
./update_version.sh 4.3.0
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to 4.3.0"
git push
# Then update cfss_releases and create release there
```

## üîß Fix "App is Damaged" Error

### For Your Local Build
The build script now automatically fixes this, but if needed:
```bash
xattr -cr /path/to/CFSS.app
```

### For Downloaded Apps (Users Getting "App is Damaged" Error)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Do NOT click "Move to Trash" - this is normal for unsigned apps**

**Option 1: Use the Fix Script (Easiest)**
```bash
# Download macos_fix.sh from GitHub releases
chmod +x macos_fix.sh
./macos_fix.sh
```

**Option 2: Terminal Method (Most Reliable)**
```bash
# Navigate to where you extracted the app
cd ~/Downloads  # or wherever you extracted it

# Remove quarantine attributes
xattr -cr CFSS.app

# Move to Applications (optional)
mv CFSS.app /Applications/

# Now it should open normally
open /Applications/CFSS.app
```

**Option 3: Right-click Method**
1. **DO NOT** click "Move to Trash" in the first dialog
2. Right-click CFSS.app ‚Üí **Open** (not double-click)
3. Click **Open** in the security dialog that appears
4. App should now open and be trusted

**Option 4: System Settings (If blocked)**
1. Try to open the app (it will be blocked)
2. System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the blocked app message
4. Try opening the app again

## üõ°Ô∏è Windows Defender Warning

### For Windows Users
When you first run `CFSS.exe`, Windows Defender SmartScreen will show a warning:

**"Windows protected your PC" or "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting"**

**This is normal for unsigned applications. To run the app:**

1. **Click "More info"** in the Windows Defender dialog
2. **Click "Run anyway"** button that appears
3. The app will now start and be trusted for future runs

**Alternative method:**
- Right-click `CFSS.exe` ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí **Unblock** ‚Üí **OK**
- Then double-click to run normally

## üì¶ Distribution Process

### 1. Prepare Release
```bash
# Update version if needed
./update_version.sh 4.3.0

# Build and test locally
./build_macos.sh

# Test with draft release
./draft_release.sh
```

### 2. Create Official Release
```bash
# Make sure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for release v4.3.0"
git push

# Create the release
./release.sh
```

### 3. Share with Users
- Send them: https://github.com/rc91470/cfss_releases/releases
- Include the installation guide (INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the app for testing
python cfss_app.py

# Or use VS Code task: Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Run Task" ‚Üí "Run CFSS App"
```

### Before Releasing
```bash
# Test build
./build_macos.sh

# Test the built app
open dist/CFSS.app

# If satisfied, create draft
./draft_release.sh
```

## üìÅ Key Files & Locations

python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try building again
./build_macos.sh
```

### Release Fails
```bash
# Check GitHub authentication
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth login

# Try again
./draft_release.sh
```

### App Won't Run (Downloaded from GitHub)
**The "App is Damaged" error is normal for unsigned apps. DO NOT trash the app.**

```bash
# First, find where you extracted the app
cd ~/Downloads  # or your extraction location

# Remove quarantine (most important step)
xattr -cr CFSS.app

# Check what attributes were removed
xattr -l CFSS.app  # Should show no quarantine attributes

# Move to Applications and try to open
mv CFSS.app /Applications/
open /Applications/CFSS.app
```

**If still having issues:**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la /Applications/CFSS.app/Contents/MacOS/

# Try running the executable directly
/Applications/CFSS.app/Contents/MacOS/cfss_app
```

### Windows Won't Run (Downloaded from GitHub)
**Windows Defender warning is normal for unsigned apps.**

**If you see "Windows protected your PC" or white/invisible dialog boxes:**

1. **Windows Defender Fix:**
   - Click **"More info"** in the Windows Defender dialog
   - Click **"Run anyway"** button that appears
   - App will now be trusted

2. **If dialog boxes have white text on white background:**
   - This is a Windows display scaling issue
   - Try running as administrator: Right-click CFSS.exe ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
   - Or try changing Windows display scaling to 100% temporarily

3. **Alternative unblock method:**
   - Right-click CFSS.exe ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí **Unblock** ‚Üí **OK**
   - Then double-click to run normally
